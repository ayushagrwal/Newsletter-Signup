# Newsletter-Signup

In this newsletter signup website, I used NodeJS, ExpressJS, Bootstrap, and the MailChimp API. 
NodeJS helped in building the backend of the website efficiently and I've used ExpressJS as the web framework to handle routing and middleware, making it easy to set up the various endpoints for the API calls. Bootstrap provided a clean and responsive design for the frontend, ensuring that the website would look great on any device. The MailChimp API was integrated into the project to enable users to sign up for the newsletter and manage their subscriptions. Overall, this technology stack allowed me to create a seamless and user-friendly newsletter website that met all of the project requirements.
